## Addition of Vectors in 2D
### Geometric Method of Adding Vectors 
Using Pythagoras' theorem:
- Calculate the magnitude of the vector & its direction (trigonometry $\theta$)
- Find the resultant vectors that are right angles to each other
$$\begin{gather}
\large{\text{Pythagoras theorem}:} \\
\large c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}
\end{gather} $$
## Vector Components
Horizontal and vertical vector components are *independent* of each other.

The components of a vector can be found using trigonometry.

In this case for vector $A$:
$$\large F_{x}+F_{y}=F$$
No component of the vector can be larger than the vector itself

###### Example
![[vector1.png]]

To find the vertical and horizontal components:
$$\large
\begin{gather}
F_{y}=F\times \sin(\theta^{\circ}) \\
F_{y}=50\text N\times \sin(40^{\circ}) \\
F_{y}=32.139 \\
F_{y} \approx 32.1\text N
\end{gather}$$
$$\large
\begin{gather}
F_{x}=F\times \cos(\theta^{\circ}) \\
F_{x}=50\text N\times \cos(40^{\circ}) \\
F_{x}=38.30\overline{2} \\
F_{x} \approx 38.3\text N
\end{gather}$$
## Projectile Motion
#### Projectile Motion
All Projectiles follow a parabolic path

Horizontal & vertical components are independent

#### Vertical Projectile Motion
The vertical acceleration of the object moving in the projectile motion is always travelling at $9.8 \text{m/s}^2$ downward due to gravity.

> [!info] Total Travel Time
> The time it takes to reach maximum height (when v=0) multiplied by 2 gives the total travel time
> 
> A the maximum point, the vertical velocity is 0
> 
> The time it takes for an object to reach maximum height is equal to the time the object takes to fall back down
> 

### Horizontal Projectile Motion

**During horizontal projectile motion, there is NO horizontal acceleration**. $\therefore$ the horizontal velocity of the object stays constant.

#### When Launched Horizontally
The initial vertical velocity $(u_{y})=0$ (but increases in magnitude during the flight)
The horizontal velocity is constant and is equal to the launch velocity when launched horizontally
$$\large {u_{x}=v_{x}=\frac{s_{x}}{t}}$$
#### Projectiles Launched At An Angle
When launched at an angle:
- The flight path will be symmetrical
- The horizontal velocity of the object stays constant as there is no horizontal acceleration

> [!important] Initial Velocities
> $u_{y}=v\sin \theta$
> $u_{x}=v\cos \theta$

$v$ is the initial / launch velocity
$\theta$ is the projectile angle

#### Equations
$$\Large
\begin{gather*}
v_{y} =gt+u_{y} \\
s_{y}=\frac{1}{2}gt^{2}+u_{y}t\\
v^{2}_{y}=2gs_{y}+u^{2}_{y}\\
v_{x}=u_{x}\\
s_{x}=u_{x}t
\end{gather*}$$
## Inclined Planes
### Inclined Planes
An inclined plane is an object that can either be at rest or moving with a constant velocity or accelerating down/up the slope.

> [!info] Inclined Planes
> The sum of all the forces acting on the crate = $mass \times acceleration$
> 
> If $F_{net} = 0 \to$ the object is stationary **or** the object is moving at a constant velocity.

### Drawing Free-Body Diagrams
- The weight component needs to be separated into different components
- Any frictional forces will always act parallel to the plane & points up the slope

```ad-summary
title: Friction
Kinetic friction is when an object slides down, the frictional force acts to oppose its motion

Static friction is when the object is at rest but still on the slope. Friction is still there in the form of static friction.
Static friction also cancels out the force component that would cause the object to slide.

```
![[Free-body-diagram-showing-external-forces-acting-on-our-models-cyclist-bicycle.png]]
### Common Situations
- The applied force is up the incline
- The applied force is down the incline
- There is no applied force

### Applied Force up the Incline
If a car is accelerating up the inclined plane:
- The net force is parallel to the plane must = 0
$\therefore$ the acceleration of the car is:
$$\Large
a={\frac{-F_{net\;parallel}}{m}=\frac{-F_{A}-F_{gx}+F_{f}}m}$$
$$\Large
F_{net}=ma=F_{A}-F_{f}-F_{gx}$$
### No Applied Force
When the friction is smaller than $F_{gy}\to$ object will accelerate
When the friction $=F_{gy}\to$ object will move at a constant speed or remain stationary.

### Acceleration of an Object on Friction-less Surface
$$\Large
a=g\sin \theta
$$
As the angle of the incline is increased, the $\large \sin \theta$ gets closer to 1
- This means that the acceleration of an object gets closer to $\large 9.8m/s^2$.
### Finding the Value of the Net Force

> [!NOTE] Calculating Net Force:
> $$\Large F_{gx}=F_{g}\sin \theta$$
>$$\Large F_{\text{net}}=mg\sin \theta$$ 

#### Steps to solve Inclined Plane Problems
1. List the info given
2. Draw a free-body diagram
3. Label each force acting on the mass
4. If the mass is accelerating: there will be a force in the direction of its acceleration
5. If the mass is not accelerating: there is 0 net force.

#### Finding the Final Velocity, Time or Displacement of the Mass
$$\Large
\begin{gather*}
v=u+at\\
s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2\\
v^{2}=u^{2}+2as\\
s=\left( \frac{{u+v}}{2} \right)t
\end{gather*}$$
## Circular Motion
### Describing Circular Motion
The motion of an object travelling at a constant speed in a circle due to a force acting on the object in a perpendicular direction to the velocity of the object.

> Whenever an object moves with a constnat speed in a circle, it is changing 3 quantities:
> 1. The durection of its motion
> 2. The angle from its starting position
> 3. The distance from its starting position


> [!info] Calculation of the Distance from A to A`
> If $\theta$ is in radians: $r \Delta \theta$
> If $\theta$ is in degrees: $\frac{{r\pi \Delta \theta}}{180}$
