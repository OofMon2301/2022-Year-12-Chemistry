A sample is vaporised and injected into an ionisation chamber. Here it is bombarded with high energy electrons, which knock electrons of the molecules to form positively charged ions. These ions are accelerated by an electric field, then deflected by a magnetic field.

The magnetic field will separate out ions as they are deflected by different amounts. 

# Infrared Spectroscopy

Molecules have different mods of vibration. Organic molecules will absorb infrared at different wavelengths.
