# Amino Acids
#Chemistry

An amino acid is a carbon compound with both an amine group (-NH2) and a carboxyl group (-COOH).Both of these groups are **attached to the same carbon,** which we call the central carbon atom. It has two more groups attached: a **hydrogen atom** (H) and a **variable amino acid side chain** (when unspecified, we use R). This is the general structure.

The side chain (or R group) is what makes each amino acid unique. In the amino acid glycine, the side chain is a humble hydrogen atom, but there are many different kinds of side chains, such as the aromatic carbon structure in the amino acid tryptophan:

## Properties of Amino Acids

Non-polar amino acids have non-polar side chains, typically alkyl groups. 

---

Polar amino acids contain polar groups such as $-OH$ or $-CONH_2$.

---

Positively-charged amino acids typically contain additional $-NH_2$  groups.

In solution, the -NH₂ group accepts a proton, becoming a -NH₃⁺ group. As a result, it is also basic.

---

Negatively-charged amino acids typically contain additional $-COOH$  groups.

## Amino Acid Reactions

---

Amino acids react together in a condensation reaction to form a **peptide**.

In a condensation reaction, the carboxyl group $-COOH$, of one amino acid reacts with the amino group $-NH_2$ of the other amino acid. This produces a **peptide (or amido)** link between the carbon atom of the carboxyl group and the nitrogen atom of the amino group. 

The reason we call this a condensation reaction is because another molecule is squeezed out of the reaction: water. It is formed from the hydroxy group of the carboxyl group and a hydrogen atom from the amino group.

## Zwitterions

Amino acids also share common properties, their ability to form zwitterions.

We are more likely to see the zwitterion in solutions with a **moderate-to-neutral** pH.

A zwitterion comes about when the weakly acidic $-COOH$ group of the amino acid donates its proton to the weekly basic $-NH_2$ group. On the surface, this subtle change has no effect: both molecules still have a **net neutral charge.**

However, as the diagram above shows, the regular amino acid (on the left) has a **uniform distribution** of neutral charge; in the zwitterion, $-NH{_3^+}$is **slightly positive** and the $-COO^-$ group is **slightly negative.** This is what defines a zwitterion: it is a molecule with **separate** positively and negatively charged groups.

As the pH swings one way or another, the amino acid **changes its form**  accordingly.

---

****Amino acids may act as an acid or a base depending on the pH of the solution.****

When the solution is **acidic,**
 there is an **excess of protons $(H^+)$.** This means that both the  amino and the carboxyl group **pick up protons,** existing as $-NH{_3^+}$and $-COOH$ respectively.Altogether, the amino acid has a **net positive charge,**
 and is in acid form (cationic form).

## Isoelectric Point

****The isoelectric point (pI) is the pH where the amino acid is at a net neutral charge, i.e. where the zwitterionic form is most dominant.****

Anything below the isoelectric point is acidic for the amino acid (will pick up an extra hydrogen).

Any pH higher than the isoelectric point, the amino acid will give up a $H^+$is an acidic solution.

---

****We can make use of the isoelectric point in electrophoresis.****

Electrophoresis is a procedure that **separates molecules** based on their movement under the influence of an **electric field.** To perform this procedure, scientists insert a solution of **mixed molecules** in the middle of a **medium** (typically a gel). They buffer the pH of the medium to a **set value,** and then apply an electric field.

When the pH is **more acidic** than the pI, the amino acid becomes positively charged, so it **moves to the cathode.**

When the pH is **more basic** than the pI, the amino acid becomes negatively charged, so it **moves to the anode.**

## Primary and Secondary Structure of Proteins

---

The **most simple**  form of a protein is the **primary structure.** This level of organisation involves the **number, type and sequence of amino acids.**

The amino acids within the primary structure are **covalently bonded** together to **form a polypeptide chain;** you can think of this chain almost like different coloured marbles threaded onto a string.

****Polypeptide chains have two distinct ends:****

If we look at the **amino acid cysteine,** shown in the image to the right, we can see that this molecule has **different functional groups** on either end. On the left-hand side of the molecule is an **amino group $-NH_2$** also known as an amine group, while on the right-hand side of the molecule is a **carboxyl group $-COOH$**

![https://www.educationperfect.com/media/content/Science/1603848493.56680871g/1603848495005-3887117589746760.png](https://www.educationperfect.com/media/content/Science/1603848493.56680871g/1603848495005-3887117589746760.png)

A peptide link joins amino acids together to create polypeptide chains. However, despite the length of the polypeptide chain, one end of the chain will have an **amino acid with an exposed amino group** which is called the **N-terminal amino acid.** Likewise, the other end of the chain will have an **amino acid with an exposed carboxyl group** which is called the **C-terminal amino acid.**

When **drawing** the primary protein structure, the polypeptide chain is **always written** with the **N-terminal** amino acid to the **left,** and the **C-terminal** amino acid to the **right.**

****Hydrogen bonds can form between peptide links due to the polar nature of the$-NH$ group and the $-CO$  of another amino acid.** The **side chains,** or RRR groups, poke outwards from the coil and are **able to rotate.** This is an important feature for the next level of protein structure.

![https://www.educationperfect.com/media/content/Science/1602619176.06118921g/1602619177774-2691827735950574-800.png](https://www.educationperfect.com/media/content/Science/1602619176.06118921g/1602619177774-2691827735950574-800.png)

Instead of hydrogen bonds forming in a way that produces a coil, β-pleated sheets are formed **between peptide links** on **neighbouring sections of polypeptide chains. In the image to the right, you can see that the backbone of a polypeptide chain has a recurring pattern in the atoms, $-N-C-C-N-C-C-$.**Amino acids with **smaller side chains**
 are able to **line up much more accurately** to form β-pleated sheets than those with larger side chains. This more accurate alignment means that **they stabilise the protein structure.**

## Lipids

***At its most basic, a triglyceride is made up of one alcohol and three fatty acids*.** ^f2996a

The alcohol in question is **glycerol,** a three-carbon molecule with three hydroxy groups attached $-OH$. The three fatty acids are all carboxylic acid alternatives, containing the carboxyl group $-COOH$ and a long carbon chain. ^c630db

![https://www.educationperfect.com/media/content/Science/1610393902.1920981g/1610393901729-3420325891105589.png](https://www.educationperfect.com/media/content/Science/1610393902.1920981g/1610393901729-3420325891105589.png)

**The fatty acids of triglycerides need not always be identical.** When they are, naming the triglyceride is easy. For example, **linolein** is a triglyceride **only containing linoleic acid.** When they aren’t, we simply call the molecule a triglyceride.

****We classify triglycerides based on whether their fatty acids are saturated or unsaturated.**** ^4c527f

A fatty acid is saturated when it contains single Carbon bonds. A fatty acid is unsaturated when it contains double or even triple carbon bonds. Saturated fatty acids are typically **linear and tightly packed,** 
whereas unsaturated fatty acids are **kinked and do not pack as easily.** 
Saturation affects a triglyceride's **physical properties.** ^a9d914
