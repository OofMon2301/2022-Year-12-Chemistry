# Buffer
#Chemistry 


**A Buffer is a solution/s which resist changes in pH when small quantities of acid or alkali are added.**

Acidic Buffer (pH < 7) made from a weak acid + it's sodium or potassium salt

Alkaline buffer (pH > 7) made from a weak base + it's chloride

It is essential to have a weak acid for an equilibrium to be present so that ions can be removed and produced. The dissociation is small and there are few ions.

$CH_3COOH \rightleftharpoons CH_3COO^-{_{(aq)}} + H^+{_{(aq)}}$

A strong acid can't be used as it is fully dissociated and cam't remove $H^+{_{(aq)}}$

$HCL{_{(aq)}} \rightarrow Cl^-{_{(aq)}} + H^+{_{(aq)}}$

Adding acid

Any $H^+$is removed by reacting with $CH_3COO^-$ions to form $CH_3COOH$ via the equilibrium. Unfortunately, the concentration of $CH_3COO^-$is small and only a few $H^+$can be 'mopped up'. A much larger concentration of $CH_3COO^-$is required.

In titration, at the half-equivalence point, the acid solution is acting as a buffer; hence, gradient is low. At this point, half the solution is neutralised, and the proportion between the undissociated and dissociated buffer is equal.

At the half-equivalence point, the $K_a$value is equal to the $H^+$ions and the $pK_a$value is equal to the pH.
