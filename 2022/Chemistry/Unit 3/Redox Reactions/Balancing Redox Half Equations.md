# Balancing Redox Half Equations
#Chemistry 

1. Work out formula of the species before and after the change.
2. Work out the oxidation state of the element before and after the change
3. Add electrons to one side of the equation so that the oxidation states balance.
4. If the charges on the species (ions and electrons) on either side of the quation do not balance then add sufficient $H^+$ions to one of the sides to balance the charges
5. If equation still doesn't balance, add sufficient water molecules to one side.
6.
