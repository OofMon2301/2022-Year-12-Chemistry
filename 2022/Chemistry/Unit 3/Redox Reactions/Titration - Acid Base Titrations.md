**Key Concepts**

- ***Arrhenius Acid***: A substance that yields hydrogen ions ($H^+$) when dissolved in water.
- ***Arrhenius Base:*** A substance that yields hydroxide ions ($OH^-$) when dissolved in water.
- ***Bronsted acid :*** A substance capable of donationg a proton. ^bfcc4e
- ***Bronsted base:*** A substance capable of accepting a proton.
- ***Chemical Equilibrium:*** A state in which the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal.
- ***Chemical Reaction:*** A process in which a substance (or substances) is changed into one or more new substances.
- ***End point:*** The volume of titrant required for the detection of the equivalence point.
- ***Equilibrium constant:*** A number equal to the ratio of the equilibrium concen- trations of products to the equilibrium concentrations of reactants, each raised tothe power of its stoichiometric coefficient.
- ***Equivalence point:*** The point at which the acid has completely reacted with or been neutralized by the base.
- ***Indicators:*** Substancesthathavedistinctlydifferentcoloursinacidicandbasic media.
- ***Molar solubility:*** The number of moles of solute in one litre of a saturated solution ($\text{mol/L}$)
- ***Monoprotic acid:*** Each unit of the acid yields one hydrogen ion upon ionization.
- ***Neutralization reaction:*** A reaction between an acid and a base.
- ***Precipitation reaction:*** A reaction that results in the formation of a precipitate.
- ***Primary Standard:*** a high purity compound used to prepare the standard solution or to standardize the solution with.
- ***Quantitative analysis:*** The determination of the amount of substances present in a sample.
- ***Secondary Standard:*** a second material used as a substitute for a suitable primary standard. This standard solution should always be standardized using a primary standard.
- ***Solubility product, $K_{sp}$***: The equilibrium constant for the reaction in which a solid salt dissolves to give its constituent ions in solution. It expresses the equilibrium between a solid and its ions in solution.
- ***Standardization:*** The process by which the concentration of a solution is deter- mined.
- ***Standard Solution:*** A solution of accurately known concentration.
- ***Stoichiometry:*** The quantitative study of reactants and products in a chemical reaction.
- ***Stoichiometric amounts:*** The exact molar amounts of reactants and products that appear in the balanced chemical equation.
- ***Strong acids:*** Strong electrolytes which are assumed to ionize completely in water.
- ***Strong bases***: Strong electrolytes which are assumed to ionize completely in water.
- ***Titration***: The gradual addition of of a solution of accurately known concentration to another solution of unknown concentration until the chemical reaction between the two solutions is complete.
- Volumetric methods of analysis:based on the measurement of the amount of reagent that combines with the analyte. The terms volumetric analysis specifically involves the determination of the volume of the reagent solution needed for a complete reaction.
- ***Volumetric titrimetry:*** methods that require that a reagent solution of known concentration, *standard solution or titrant*, be used.

$$
H_3O^++OH^-\rightarrow 2H_2O
$$

$$
HCl+NaOH\rightarrow NaCl +H_2O
$$

When the moles of the $\text{NaOH}$ equal to the moles of $\text{HCl}$, that point is called the equivalence point.

### Find unknown concentration of the acid.

1. Find the moles of the known substance.
2. Use the balanced equation to get the number of moles of the acid/analyte.
