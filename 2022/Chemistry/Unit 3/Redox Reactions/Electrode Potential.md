## Cell Potential

Each electrode/electrolyte combination has its own half-reaction which sets up a potential difference.

The value is affected by:

Equation:

$\text{Cell Voltage}= \text{Reduction} \space - \text{Oxidation}$

The reaction that takes place will involve the more positive one reversing the other:

$$
Cu^{2+}
