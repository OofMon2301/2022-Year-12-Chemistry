# Equilibria
#Chemistry 

At equilibrium, the ratio of the concentrations of products to reactants is constant. The ratio value is called the equilibrium constant, $K_c$. It is always the same for a particular equation under fixed conditions.

### The Equilibrium Constant

---

For the general reaction:

$$
aA+bB\rightleftharpoons cC+dD
$$

the equilibrium constant $K_c$ is given by:

$$
K_c={[C]^c[D]^d \above{1pt} [B]^B[A]^a}
$$

Square brackets mean the concentration and the formula is only given for gases and aqueous solutions.
