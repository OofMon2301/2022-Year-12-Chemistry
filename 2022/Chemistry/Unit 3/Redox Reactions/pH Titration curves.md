### General

---

Many indicators are weak acids and partially dissociate in aqueous solutions

$$
\text {HIn}{_{(aq)}} \rightleftharpoons H^+{_{(aq)}}+ In^-{_{(aq)}}
$$

The un-ionised form (HIn) is a different colour to the anionic form.

Apply Le Chatelier's Principle to predict any colour change

In Acid:

- Increase of $[H^+]$
- equilibrium moves to the left to give red undissociated form
    
    In Alkali:
    
- Increase of $[OH^-]$
- $OH^-$ions remove $H^+$ions to form water; $H^+{_{(aq)}} + OH^-{_{(aq)}} \rightleftharpoons H_2O{_{(l)}}$
- equilibrium moves to the right to produce a blue colour

### Acid Base Indicators

- Must have an easily observable colour change.
- Must change immediately in the required pH range over the addition of 'half' a drop of reagent (the solution in your burette).
    
    To be useful, an indicator must change over the “vertical” section of the curve where there is a large change in pH for the addition of a very small volume of alkali. 
    
    The indicator used depends on the pH changes around the end point - the indicator must change during the ‘vertical’ portion of the curve.

In the example, the only suitable indicator is Phenolphthalein.

There are four types of acid-base titration; each has a characteristic curve.

1. Strong Acid $\text {HCl}$ vs. Strong Base $\text {NaOH}$
2. Weak Acid $\text {CH}_3\text {COOH}$ vs weak base NH_3
3. Strong Acid HCL vs weak base NH_3
4. Weak acid CH_3COOH vs weak base NH_3

In the following examples, alkali(0.1M) is added to 25cm ^3 of acid (0.1M).

End points need not be "neutral" due to salt hydrolysis (you don't have to know about this)
