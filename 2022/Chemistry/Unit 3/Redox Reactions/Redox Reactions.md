# Redox Reactions
#Chemistry 
Oxidation states are used to tell if oxidation or reduction has taken place. They are also used to work out what has been oxidised and/or reduced. They can be used to construct half equations and balance redox reactions.

## Atoms and Simple Ions

The number of electrons which must be added or removed to become neutral.

### Oxidation States

Atoms = 0

Cations = +1

Anions = -1

$Na\space  \text{in}\space Na^+ = 0$

$H \space \text{in}\space H_2 = 0$ - Both are the same and must add up to zero

$C \space \text{in}\space CO_2 = +4$ - 

$O \space \text{in}\space CO_2 = -2$

### How do you determine which is the positive one?

$NO_2{^{-}}$ Sum of the oxidations states = -1

$SO_4{^{2-}}$ Sum of the oxidation states = -2

$NH_4{^{+}}$ Sum of the oxidations states = +1

### Calculating Oxidation State - 1

Many elements can exist in more than one oxidation state

In compounds, certain elements are used as benchmarks to work out other values.

Hydrogen is always +1 unless When it is on it's own or bonded to itself, or when it is bonded to a metal.
