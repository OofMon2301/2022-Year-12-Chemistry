## Macro-molecules
### Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are sugar monomers which progressively get more complex.
- Glucose
- Fructose
- Galactose

These are [[Revision - Units 3 & 4#^a4c19a|monosaccharides]] and can form as either a straight chain or $\alpha$-ring. 

[[Revision - Units 3 & 4#^1ba952|Disaccharides]] are just two monosaccharides, which is just two sugar monomers.

When paired with specific sugar monomers (monosaccharides), they are linked with a specific form of [[Revision - Units 3 & 4#^cf26b1|glycosidic]] (covalent) bond between each [[Revision - Units 3 & 4#^a4c19a|monosaccharides]].

- Fructose + Glucose = Sucrose
	- 1-4 glycosidic link | ==$\alpha$-1,$\beta$-2 glycosidic link==
- Glucose + Galactose = Lactose
	- $\beta$ 1-4 glycosidic link
- Glucose + Glucose = Maltose
	- $\alpha$ 1-4 glycosidic link

[[Revision - Units 3 & 4#^84de94|Polysaccharides]] are just complex sugars from the monosaccharides.
- [[Revision - Units 3 & 4#^f5c9de|Starch]]
- [[Revision - Units 3 & 4#^5c4a6e|Cellulose]]
- Glycogen

**Starch** contains amylose and amylopectin.
Amylose to amylopectin ratio is 20-80%.

Amylose is non soluble while amylopectin is kinda soluble because more branching

- - -
 [[Revision - Units 3 & 4#^5c4a6e|Cellulose]] is very strong in terms of strength because the bonds between each ring is very strong because the other one is flipped upside down (idk the word) and that causes it to be very strong.

### Proteins
Proteins are just basically amino acids with peptide bonds

How to draw [[Revision - Units 3 & 4#^62eec2|amino acids]] (general)

It very good

4 Types/Structure of proteins

[[Revision - Units 3 & 4#^1b7969|Primary amino acids]]

[[Revision - Units 3 & 4#^ed05e4|Secondary amino acids]]

[[Revision - Units 3 & 4#^209a2d|Tertiary amino acids]]

[[Revision - Units 3 & 4#^486122|Quaternary]]

### Lipids

[[Revision - Units 3 & 4#^8d84d9|Lipids]] are fats
Fats can be [[Amino Acids#^a9d914|unsaturated or saturated]].

They can form a [[Amino Acids#^f2996a|Triglyceride]]. It contains one [[Amino Acids#^c630db|glycerol]] and three [[Amino Acids#^f2996a|fatty acids]].
