## Haber Process 

^655e50

The Haber process is an industrialised process by some guy named Haber as his surname for the process of ammonia.
$$N_{2}+3H_{2}\rightleftharpoons 2NH_{3}$$
## Contact Process

^ad0ad5

Contact process is an industrialised process to make Sulphuric Acid.
It has four steps.
1. $S+O_{2}\to SO_{2}$
2. $2SO_{2}+O_{2}\rightleftharpoons 2SO_{3}$
3. $2SO_{3}+H_{2}O\to H_{2}S_{2}O_{7}$
4. $H_{2}S_{2}O_{7}+H_{2}O\rightleftharpoons 2H_{2}SO_{4}$

## Lipids
Lipids are one or more [[Revision - Units 3 & 4#^30a072|fatty acids]] and are mostly insoluble in water (hydrophobic). Animal fats contain triglyceride and other fats are detergents.

Fatty acids are just carboxylic acids with long carbon chain. They can be saturated or unsaturated

##### Saturated
Contain no double bonds in the chain

##### Unsaturated 
Contain one or more double bonds in the chain
- Mono-unsaturated means ==one== double bond
- Poly-unsaturated means ==more than one== double bond.

[[Revision - Units 3 & 4#^c174ed|Triglycerides]] are fats formed with 3 fatty acids of any length and glycerol (propane-1,2,3-triol) and form ester linkages between the alcohol and the carboxylic acids.

[[Revision - Units 3 & 4#^2eb25c|Saponification]] is a way to make triglycerides into soaps and is conducted through the addition of an NaOH to break the ester link.

## Soaps
Soaps have polar and non-polar ends, meaning that they have hydrophobic (non-polar) and hydrophilic (polar) ends. 

Hydrophilic end carries water while hydrophobic ends carry oil and dirt.

If you wash soap with [[Revision - Units 3 & 4#^84769f|hard water]], then it contains 'scum'.
![[Revision - Units 3 & 4#^87f2e2]]

There are 3 ways to clean 'scum':
1. Use more soap until no more metal ions
2. Add a alkali (NaOH) to the scum to neutralise
3. Use detergent (opposites and more effective soaps)
