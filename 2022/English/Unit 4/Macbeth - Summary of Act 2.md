## Act 2, Scene 1

---

Outside Macbeth’s castle, Banquo comments on the extraordinary darkness of the night and tries to pray. Macbeth enters and talks uneasily with Banquo. After Banquo and his son Fleance leave, Macbeth experiences a hallucination of a dagger. He sets off to commit the murder.

Line 34: 

> “Is this a dagger, which I see before me”
> 

Line 37:

> “Fatal vision”
> 

Macbeth suggests his hallucination is sent by Fate; this deed is now beyond his control:

> “Witchcraft celebrates….. moves like a ghost”
> 

Macbeth’s mind is full of the supernatural murder.

### Banquo’s Inner Battle

---

Despite being fatigued, Banquo is avoiding sleep because of “cursed thoughts” that invade his unconscious (8). Unlike Macbeth, Banquo is able to resist traitorous ideas when he is awake, but he cannot erase such thoughts from his dreams. The fact that Banquo is also plagued by these thoughts, albeit in his sleep, allows us to have some sympathy for Macbeth. If Banquo were able to dismiss altogether any thoughts of his family assuming control of the throne, we may condemn Macbeth further for his inability to reign in his ambitions. When Macbeth enters the scene, he and Banquo discuss their encounter with the weird sisters. Banquo explicitly states that he does not wish to take an active role in helping Macbeth become king. He tells Macbeth, “So I lose none / In seeking to augment it, but still keep / My bosom franchis’d and allegiance clear, I shall be counsell’d” (26–28). He does, however, agree to discuss the matter further as long as he will not lose honor or stain his allegiance to Duncan. Banquo resolves to honor his commitment to Duncan, placing him in opposition to Lady Macbeth, who has convinced Macbeth that commitment to regicide is more honorable than commitment to the king. Shakespeare deviates significantly from his historical source by not having Banquo serve as Macbeth’s accomplice in Duncan’s murder. This deviation ennobles Banquo, who keeps his loyalty intact. It also may have served the practical political purpose of flattering James I, Banquo’s alleged descendant. At the same time, this plot change removes a potential point of sympathy for Macbeth because Banquo, who harbors the same ambitious thoughts as Macbeth, does not take action against the king.

### Preparing for Murder

---

Macbeth orders his servant to “bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready / She strike upon the bell” (31–32). Some critics argue that the line does not refer to an actual drink being prepared for Macbeth. Instead, this line may provide the servant with an explanation of the ringing bell in advance. Furthermore, Macbeth’s reference to the drink may metaphorically link back to the “poisoned chalice” of betrayal that he mentioned in his previous soliloquy (I.7.11). Clearly, Lady Macbeth is to ring the bell when all is ready for Macbeth to commit the murder. Following the servant’s departure, Macbeth speaks his second crucial soliloquy. Once again, there is fissure between illusion and reality as Macbeth imagines that he sees a dagger hovering in the air in front of him. Previously, Macbeth was responsible for creating the disparity between illusion and reality; he put on a “false face” to hide his ambitions. Now, a shift has occurred, and Macbeth is the victim of the disparity between illusion and reality; he cannot distinguish between the two. Notice that the evil and disorder in which he is participating horrifies Macbeth but does not dissuade him from his course of action. In the midst of his soliloquy, Macbeth refers to Hecate. Hecate was originally the name of the Roman goddess of the night; however, she is traditionally associated with the devil and specifically believed to be the guardian of witches. Scholars speculate that this reference may have inspired dramatist Thomas Middleton to add the appearance of Hecate in Act III, Scene 5. (See the “Introduction to Macbeth” for an explanation of Middleton’s role in creating the text of the play.) When the bell calls Macbeth to his deed, his response reveals a slight shift in thinking. When he was pondering the murder earlier, he was assured of the king’s salvation because of Duncan’s many virtues (I.7.16–28). Now, he hopes that Duncan cannot hear the bell that either summons the king “to heaven or to hell” (64). Macbeth is no longer certain that the king is bound for heaven, which makes the cruelty of his crime even greater.

Macbeth Murders Duncan. (Robert Dudley, 1856)

## Act 2, Scene 2

---

Lady Macbeth enters while her husband is murdering Duncan. She has drugged the King’s two attendants. Macbeth enters with blood upon his hands - the deed is done. However, he has forgotten to leave the daggers with the attendants so that the suspicion for the crime will fall upon them. Lady Macbeth takes the daggers back for him. The sound of knocking is heard at the front gate. His wife tells him to go and with the blood from his hands. Macbeth expresses the wish that Duncan were still alive. The action of this scene immediately follows the action of Act II, Scene 1. Minimal time has passed as the play’s perspective switches from Macbeth to his accomplice, Lady Macbeth. Lady Macbeth says that she has heard an owl, which “shriek’d . . . the stern’st good-night” (3 – 4). The owl, with its nocturnal behavior and night-piercing call, was thought to be the form in which the devil appeared to witches. Its cries in the night were generally considered bad omens.

### Lady Macbeth’s Role

---

Lady Macbeth’s lines convey her active role in the regicide. She has drugged Duncan’s servants so that Macbeth can enter and leave Duncan’s chamber unnoticed. (As we will see, the Macbeths also consider the servants the natural choices for men to frame with the king’s murder.) Lady Macbeth’s participation in the events surrounding the murder differs from the role she plays in Shakespeare’s source, the Holinshed Chronicles. Holinshed does show Lady Macbeth convincing her husband to take action against Duncan. But the act of drugging the king’s guards and later placing the daggers in their possession seems to be based on a different story related by Holinshed — the story of the murder of King Duffe by Donwald and his wife. Continuing the bold statements she has used in earlier scenes, Lady Macbeth claims that she would have committed the crime herself if Duncan did not resemble her father. This line is significant in a number of ways. First, it illustrates that there is a disjunction between Lady Macbeth’s words and deeds. Recall that in Act I, Scene 7 she told her husband that she would kill her own child if needed, but she is not at any risk for having to perform this heinous act. Second, the link to Duncan as a father figure holds significance for Macbeth as well. As seen in Act I, Scene 4, Duncan behaves in a fatherly manner toward his seemingly loyal subject.

### The Deed is Done

---

When Macbeth enters the scene, his wife says that she “heard the owl scream and the crickets cry” (16). While the owl’s scream is a bad omen, crickets traditionally were thought to make noise when a murder was committed. Macbeth has, indeed, committed the crime. Having done so, he is unable to even utter an “Amen,” which indicates his separation from God (29). The separation he experiences supports the divine right theory of kingship where God appoints kings. Not only has Macbeth violated political, ethical, and moral tenets by killing his king and cousin, he also has usurped God’s power by trying to appoint himself king. Lady Macbeth is very practical in this critical moment. Seeing that Macbeth has carried the murder weapons with him, and determining that he is incapable of returning to Duncan’s chamber, she takes over. She returns the daggers to the location of the crime and spreads Duncan’s blood on the drugged servants guarding the king’s door. She returns and chides Macbeth for becoming “lost” in his thoughts about the king’s death (71). Her behavior reveals her cruel strength, but it also reveals her shortsightedness. Lady Macbeth believes that after the murder is accomplished, its consequences will be only good. This, of course, contradicts Macbeth’s earlier sentiment that violence begets violence (I.7.7–10).

### Images of Remorse

---

Sleep has a great deal of significance in this scene and in the entire play. Macbeth introduces the theme of sleep in lines 35–36 when he claims to have heard a voice that banishes him from its comforts. Duncan and his servants were asleep when the crimes against them were committed. In contrast, Macbeth’s paranoia and his guilt over his behavior — evidenced by his inability to return to Duncan’s chamber — will prevent him from sleeping. The inability to sleep also indicates the disorder and unnaturalness of this play and, in particular, the crime of regicide. Watch for other references to sleep in the play. Try to determine how they are significant in their context and in the play as a whole. The issue of cleanliness also arises at the end of the scene. Macbeth feels such deep guilt that he realises all the water in the ocean will not clean him of the deed. Conversely, Lady Macbeth claims that a “little water” clears them of the deed (67). The issue of cleanliness also suggests a comparison to Banquo who, in the previous scene, agrees to discuss Macbeth’s ambitions as long as doing so does not “stain” his allegiance. This scene ends with Macbeth expressing his remorse over his crime, both by not wanting to know himself and also by wishing that Duncan was able to awake. Macbeth, incapable of sleeping, stands in direct contrast to Duncan, who is incapable of waking. Pay special attention to Macbeth’s line in the next scene after he greets Lennox.

## Act 2, Scene 3

---

 The knocking from the previous scene continues, awakening the Porter, who is very drunk. He imagines himself as the Porter of hell, letting all sorts of sinners, and he continues his joking as he lets in Lennox and Macduff. Macduff finds Duncan murdered. Macbeth reveals that he has killed Duncan’s two guards, whom he claims are responsible. Fearing for their lives, the King’s two sons Malcolm and Donalbain flee the country.

### The Guardian of The Gate

---

Even in the porter’s humorous dialogue, however, Shakespeare embeds serious threads and allusions. Notice how disorderly the porter is; he is drunk, unkempt, and surly. In addition, his first line refers to the “porter of hell-gate” (2). In his 20-line opening speech, he mentions the devil or hell a total of five times. Though he is being humorous, there is a sinister parallel between his activity — opening the gates of Macbeth’s castle — and opening the gates of hell. The porter’s statement about the “farmer that hanged himself on the expectation of plenty” refers to the farming practice of hoarding crops in times of abundance and low prices in order to make a great profit in time of famine (4–5). According to Sidney Lamb, for this reason some farmers would hang themselves when wonderful harvests were predicted. The porter also describes the knocker as an equivocator. This line has been used to place the composition of Macbeth in 1606, because the porter is most likely referring to a Jesuit thinker named Henry Garnet who wrote A Treatise of Equivocation. This work claimed that a statement was not a lie if it could be viewed as truth from another perspective. The porter indicates this notion by saying that his equivocator “could swear in both the scales against either scale” — meaning the person could take any side of an argument and it would be true (9–10). Garnet, in addition to being a Catholic (which was illegal in England at this time), was convicted and executed for his role in the Gunpowder Plot, the 1605 assassination attempt of James I. The porter opens the gate to let in Macduff and Lennox, who have come to summon Duncan. The theme of sleep makes a reappearance in this scene in the humorous exchange between Macduff and the porter. The porter says that drink “is a great provoker of three things . . . nose-painting, sleep, and urine” (25–27). (Nose-painting refers to the red color of the nose that often occurs when a person is inebriated.) The porter clarifies that drink’s relationship to lechery is a complicated one: “[I]t provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance” (28–29). This comical statement hauntingly echoes Macbeth’s initial indecision after hearing the sisters’ prophecy. He had the desire to become king but not the will to act on that desire.

### Unnatural Night

---

Macbeth enters and greets Macduff and Lennox. Macbeth’s brief exchange with them, through line 65, exemplifies the theory of equivocation that the porter alluded to. If we can view his responses from the right perspective, they are actually truthful. As Macduff goes to the king’s chamber, Lennox reveals that nature has been “unruly” the entire night (54). He claims to have heard “strange screams of death” in the air (56). The “obscure bird” that “[c]lamour’d the livelong night” is, again, the owl (60). Compare his report to Macbeth’s predictions of the effect of Duncan’s death on Scotland in Act I, Scene 7, Line 16–27. (Note that in Shakespeare’s tragedy Julius Caesar, Caesar’s “unnatural” death is also followed by extreme disruptions in nature.) Macduff returns and reports the king’s death. His reference to Duncan’s body as the “Lord’s anointed temple” is another statement of the divine right theory of kingship, because the king is God’s appointed deputy (69). Macduff shouts to wake the household, telling its inhabitants to “[s]hake off this downy sleep, death’s counterfeit, / And look on death itself!” (77–78). Consider how this description of sleep relates to other sleep references in the play. The question of gender also reappears in this scene as Macduff tells Lady Macbeth that merely hearing about the terrible deed would murder her. The irony in this line is twofold. First, of course, Lady Macbeth has been an active participant in the deed. Second, Macduff’s statement will eventually prove true. Duncan’s murder will haunt Lady Macbeth until she takes her own life. Ultimately, the crime does kill her.

### Feigning Innocence

---

Macbeth tries to hide his crime by killing the king’s servants, claiming that he does so out of rage over their murder of Duncan. Notice that Macduff, however, is immediately suspicious of Macbeth’s action. Macduff asks Macbeth directly why he killed them. Macbeth claims that his actions originate from his devotion and loyalty to the king. He tries to cover his traitorous deeds by demonstrating an intense loyalty to the crown, which he displays with his murderous rage against the servants. Notice that in his defense, Macbeth describes the wounds on Duncan as “a breach” in nature (114). Nature has been disrupted by this act of regicide. Duncan’s sons, Malcolm and Donalbain, also suspect that the servants were not the murderers. They decide to flee for their own safety. That the sons are not yet to the grieving stage (their “tears / Are not yet brew’d”) seems to be a comment on Macbeth’s grief, which is already great (124–125). They may suspect that his grief is insincere; however, we, knowing Macbeth’s inner thoughts, realise that he seems to have remorse for his actions. In reading the play, many of the visual and audible aspects are lost. It is important to imagine this scene and its great chaos. People shout and cry, bells ring, a large number of exits and entrances occur, characters are only half-clothed, and Lady Macbeth even faints. The stage is very busy and noisy.

### Calm in the Chaos

---

In the midst of this chaos stands Banquo. He solidly attempts to restore order to the scene. It is also likely that he already suspects Macbeth for the crime. Therefore, his resolve to fight “treasonous malice” is significant (133). Banquo is still unwilling to compromise his honor and loyalty in order to fulfill the prophecy. Many scholars and critics have attributed this admirable portrayal of Banquo as a tribute to James I, because James is supposed to have been a direct descendent in Banquo’s line of kings. The disordered scene ends with Duncan’s sons fleeing to Ireland and England. Malcolm suspects that a kinsman did the murder, because someone related to them would have the most cause to kill Duncan. This statement begins to pose the question of motive. The servants had no reason to kill their king, although Macbeth and his wife want everyone to believe that their drunken stupor is to blame. With Malcolm already named as Duncan’s heir, anyone who wanted the Scottish throne would have to kill him, too. A kinsman would have a good chance to be crowned if Malcolm died. It is interesting that rather than assume control of the country, Malcolm flees. What might Shakespeare be saying about Malcolm in this scene?

## Act 2, Scene 4

---

Ross and an old man are discussing the strange supernatural events of the previous night. Macduff enters and tells them that since Malcolm and Donalbain have fled, they have been blamed for the murder. But Macduff is not convinced that they did it. Macbeth, the most powerful man in the country, has been chosen to succeed Duncan and has gone to Scone to be crowned. Macduff has refused to attend the coronation.

### Disordered Nature

---

The old man and Ross discuss the disorders in nature that are still occurring as a result of the regicide. Many of these events occur in Holinshed’s account of King Duffe’s death, but Shakespeare integrates them into the Duncan story in order to emphasise the theme of disorder and chaos. (See the “Introduction to Macbeth” for details about Holinshed’s accounts.) Interestingly, Ross notes that darkness grips both night and day. This darkness is significant, because both Macbeth (in Act I, Scene 4) and Lady Macbeth (in Act I, Scene 5) request darkness to hide their deeds. Ironically, the darkness does not hide their actions; rather, it occurs in response to their deeds. Why might this be the case? Also note that the owl reappears. Sidney Lamb notes that the use of the owl is an alteration from Holinshed, who mentions a hawk. In light of the frequent appearance of the owl in relation to Macbeth’s deed, this deviation illustrates Shakespeare’s close integration of his source material into his own themes. The murder of a falcon by a lower bird, in this case the owl, parallels Macbeth’s crime of regicide and associates him with the owl.

### Shifting Suspicions

---

Macduff’s entry and discussion with Ross helps to accelerate the plot to the point where Duncan’s sons, having fled, are suspected of the crime. Again, the motivation of the servants is called into question. Because the servants had nothing to gain from the murder, Macduff concludes that they were hired or induced to do it. As we know, he is not quite correct but close. In addition, we learn that Macbeth has been named king. It is interesting that in being named as king, Macbeth’s claim to the throne derives from a system other than that of divine right. As we saw in the “Introduction to Macbeth,” the system of accession transformed from an election by thanes to the process of primogeniture and divine right only a few generations before the historical Macbeth became King of Scotland. Macduff’s final lines in the scene mark the reemergence of the clothing metaphor. Macduff is concerned that “our old robes sit easier than our new,” meaning that he suspects things will not go as well under Macbeth’s reign as they did under Duncan’s (38).
