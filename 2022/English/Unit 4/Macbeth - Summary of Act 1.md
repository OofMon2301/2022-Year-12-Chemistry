Macbeth and the Witches

The opening scene of Macbeth not only introduces the audience to the supernatural element that will be carried throughout the play, but it also establishes a theme of disorder through the presence of the  witches, the stormy weather, and the bleak landscape. The witches (or weird sisters) probably would have been portrayed on the stage — as they have been in modern cinematic productions — as grotesque and ugly creatures.

Audience members in Early Modern England viewed witchcraft differently than audiences do today. At that time, many people, including King James I, believed in
the presence of witches and their ability to harm and destroy virtuous people.
The witches agree that they will meet Macbeth at a particular time and place, suggesting the importance of that encounter, which will occur in Act I, Scene 3.

This is an oxymoron.

# Act 1, Scene 2

---

A wounded sergeant reports his knowledge of the battle with Norway to King Duncan. The Thane of Ross reports Scotland has gained an advantage from the traitor Thane of Cawdor. Macbeth is described to be as a brave and a hero in the war. King Duncan orders the execution of the Thane of Cawdor and  awards his title to Macbeth. 

The location of this scene stands in stark contrast to the opening scene. While Act I, Scene 1 took place on a deserted heath representing disorder, this scene opens in King Duncan’s camp, a model of order. The stage direction tells the reader that the camp is “near Forres.” This phrase was added by an editor in response to a statement made by Banquo in the following scene. Forres would have been significant to Shakespeare’s audiences because, in addition to being the Scottish capital at the time, it was the location of a famous coven of witches who allegedly attempted to shipwreck James I, the ruling King of England and Scotland.

### The Line between Good and Evil

The sergeant speaks of “[s]hipwracking storms and direful thunders” (26). In the opening scene, Shakespeare created a link between the three witches and stormy weather. He strengthens this link here through the adjective “shipwracking,” because in times past people believed that witches used storms to cause shipwrecks. The storms are immediately followed by reinforcements (“furbish’d arms”) from the Norwegian king, Sweno (32). The implication is that Macbeth is on the side of good, while Sweno is on the side of evil with the witches; the line between good and evil is very clear. The sergeant explains that despite the renewed attack, Macbeth’s good deeds and valorous behavior on the battlefield accumulate. Macbeth and his fellow captain, Banquo, are undeterred by the reinforcements and emerge victorious from the attack. Ross, a Scottish nobleman or thane, relates that the traitorous Thane of Cawdor also joined Norway in the battle against the Scots. Ross uses mythical references, calling Macbeth the bridegroom of Bellona (the Roman goddess of war), to describe Macbeth’s valor and loyalty. This scene clearly establishes Macbeth as a hero who is not only able to protect his king but does so repeatedly — defeating all of the king‘s enemies and traitors.

# Act 1, Scene 3

---

The Witches give Macbeth the three apparitions/prophecies. They also predict Banquo’s descendants will be kings. Angus and Ross tell Macbeth is the Thane of Cawdor. Macbeth is troubled by the witches’ predictions and agrees with Banquo to discuss it later.

### First Apparition

> “Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
Not so happy, yet much happier.
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none”

### Analysis

Back on the heath, in the middle of another storm, the weird sisters reunite. The opening to this scene firmly establishes the evil nature of the witches through their vengeful behavior. In his Chronicles, Holinshed refers to the weird sisters as “goddesses of destiny” (see the Introduction to Macbeth). Shakespeare does not use this name to describe them; he does not validate their claims of knowing the future and controlling fate. Therefore, the audience has no reason to trust or believe them. The audience only knows of their evil purposes. Describing their recent activities, the weird sisters decide to send stormy weather to the seafaring husband of a woman who refused to share her chestnuts with one of the witches. This moment in the play may have historical roots. News from Scotland (1591) recounts a trial presided over by James I in which a group of witches was accused of trying to shipwreck James, who was the King of Scotland at that time. In addition to indicating that the witches sailed “in a sieve,” this account claims that the king was saved through his faith (8). Shakespeare may be alluding to this trial and account by having the witches torment a ship on the sea. If so, by invoking this historical event in the play, Shakespeare invites the audience to compare James, who was tested by witches, to Banquo and Macbeth who are about to be. Keep this comparison in mind as the play progresses. The weird sisters’ level of evil seems to reach its peak with the display of “a pilot’s thumb” (28). Clearly, Shakespeare is establishing these weird sisters as Macbeth’s foes, though we have yet to know their purpose.

### The Meeting at the Heath

Macbeth and Banquo arrive, and the meeting that the witches discussed in the opening scene takes place. Macbeth is literally travelling between the battle, which represents disorder, and the capital and court, which represent order. This initial interaction between Macbeth and the weird sisters is crucial for the rest of play. The witches’ two-part prophecy drives the action. Macbeth’s first line, describing the day as “foul and fair,” strangely echoes the witches’ lines from the first scene (38). It also reminds the audience that nature is out of order. Despite the Scottish victory over their enemies, order has not been fully restored. Before seeing the weird sisters, Banquo asks about the distance to Forres, which not only indicates that he and Macbeth are returning to the capital but also recalls the witch trial in News from Scotland; the trial took place in Forres. Upon seeing the sisters, Banquo’s response gives the modern reader an idea about their appearance. He describes them as “wither’d” and “wild in their attire” (40). Their appearance is so different that he believes that they are not of this earth. Trying to place them in a category that he can understand, Banquo wants to call them women. However, notice that he is unable to do so because they have facial hair. This ambiguity of gender is significant in placing the sisters outside of nature and out of the proper order. It seems that they do not truly belong in either gender. This ambiguity initiates a question about the definitions of gender that will continue throughout the play.

### The Witches’ Predictions

Upon Macbeth’s command, the first sister greets Macbeth by calling him “Thane of Glamis,” which is his current title (48). The second sister adds that he is “Thane of Cawdor,” and the third tells him that he “shalt be king hereafter” (49–50). Because we already know that Macbeth has been granted the title of Thane of Cawdor (and we assume that he does not yet know of this title), we suspect that the sisters may be trying to manipulate Macbeth. By providing the audience with this information in the previous scene, Shakespeare makes us question the sisters’ gift of prophecy. They merely tell Macbeth something that he does not yet know. Thus, the audience remains more skeptical of the prophecy than Macbeth does. Banquo’s response provides us with a textual clue as to Macbeth’s on-stage reaction to this prophecy. He informs us that Macbeth appears fearful, which does not make sense to Banquo. In contrast to Macbeth’s reaction, Banquo boldly asks for his own prophecy, claiming that he does not fear the sisters’ words. The sisters’ second prediction indicates that Banquo will not be king himself, but his offspring will be kings.

### Succession through Death

Macbeth recovers and confronts the sisters. He informs us explicitly that he is already the Thane of Glamis; the play to this point had not established that. His statement also explains that he received the title from “Sinel’s death” (72). (According to Holinshed, Sinel was Macbeth’s father.) Note that titles in the play are gained through the death of their holder. Macbeth cannot believe that he is the Thane of Cawdor because Cawdor is alive. But he also states that being king is not “within the prospect of belief” (75). He waivers here between belief and disbelief. If Macbeth is indeed Duncan’s cousin, Macbeth’s succession to the throne is possible, but not likely. However, his lines later in this scene indicate that he does believe it is possible; he even contemplates regicide, which would facilitate it. Refusing to answer Macbeth’s questions, the witches vanish (by means of a trapdoor in the stage). The dialogue between Macbeth and Banquo after the weird sisters disappear reveals much about their characters. Banquo immediately doubts their appearance, suggesting that maybe they were a hallucination. Macbeth seems much more susceptible to their prediction, turning it into fact by telling Banquo that his (Banquo’s) children will be kings. In Holinshed’s Chronicles, the two men respond to the predictions of the witches with humor by repeating the prophecies to one another. In the play, they repeat the prophecies to each other, but Shakespeare provides no indication that they are joking as they do so.

## Imperial Ambition

---

Macbeth, not moved by Banquo’s caution, speaks another aside where he sees his current titles as prologues to an “imperial theme,” or his kingship (130). This statement is important because it is our first indication of Macbeth’s ambition to be king. Also, he refers to a suggestion that is accompanied by a “horrid image” and that will be “[a]gainst the use of nature” (136, 138). It seems clear that Macbeth already is contemplating regicide as a way of attaining the title of king. In the space of three scenes, Macbeth has moved from being an extremely loyal and capable nobleman to someone whose ambition to be king causes him to contemplate murder. Macbeth begins to resemble the world around him. The prediction, he says, has shaken his “single state of man” to a point that conjecture controls his mind (141). Like the turbulent weather, Macbeth’s mind is in a state of disorder. He is at war with himself. Although he ponders regicide, an important point in this speech is that Macbeth acknowledges that killing the king would be wrong. He concludes by rationally telling himself that the prophecy will come true without his “stir” — without his killing Duncan (145). Macbeth regains control over his evil thoughts. He still wants to be king, but he is content for now to let the crown come to him. Banquo, noticing the internal struggle that’s taking place in Macbeth, echoes Macbeth’s earlier line about borrowed robes. He explains Macbeth’s turmoil by saying that he needs time in order to become accustomed to the new titles, or “strange garments” (146). The scene ends with the men returning to the castle. At this point, Macbeth arranges with Banquo to discuss their encounter with the weird sisters at a later time. This indicates that, despite his recent conclusion that he should not act, Macbeth is still not certain about what to do.

# Act 1, Scene 4

---

King Duncan is told about the Thane of Cawdor’s execution. Macbeth enters and Duncan praises him highly, promising future rewards. Duncan proclaims his eldest son, Malcolm, the next in line for the throne, and announces his intention to stay that night at Macbeth’s castle, *Inverness.* As Macbeth leaves to make preparations for the King, he reflects that Malcolm (the Prince of Cumberland) is an obstacle preventing him from obtaining the throne/crown.

## Heir to the throne

Duncan names Malcolm, his oldest son, as his heir. The act of officially naming an heir was usually done in the interest of maintaining order through the smooth succession of kings. The practice of succession through the first-born male was a relatively new one at the time of Duncan’s reign. Just a few generations before, a council of thanes elected the Scottish king. Under the old system, Macbeth, as Duncan’s cousin, would have had a better chance to become king. Though the weird sisters did not specify how he would succeed to the throne, notice that Macbeth perceives the naming of Malcolm as heir as an event that could prevent the prediction from coming true. The disjunction between reality and illusion reappears as Macbeth asks that the stars not shine on his “black and deep desires” (51). While Macbeth still realises the difference between right and wrong, he finds himself unable to control his ambition. It is ironic that the scene begins with Duncan’s comment that it is impossible to know someone’s inner thoughts and plans, and it ends with Macbeth asking that his inner thoughts and desires be disguised.

# Act 1, Scene 5

---

Lady Macbeth reads a letter from Macbeth, informing her of his meeting with the witches and of his new title. Lady Macbeth reflects that Macbeth has the ambition to be King but lacks the ruthless nature to make it happen. A messenger brings news of Duncan’s visit. Excited by the news, Lady Macbeth calls the spirits to suppress her feminine instincts. When Macbeth enters, they begin plotting King Duncan’s murder. 

### The Letter to Lady Macbeth

> “They met me in the day of success; and I have learned by
the perfectest report, they have more in them than
mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question
them further, they made themselves air, into which
they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder 5
of it, came missives from the king, who all-hailed
me, ‘Thane of Cawdor;’ by which title, before, these
weird sisters saluted me, and referred me to the
coming on of time, with, ‘Hail, king that shalt be!’
This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest 10
partner of greatness, that thou mightest not lose the
dues of rejoicing, but being ignorant of what greatness
is promised thee. Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.”
> 

### Lady Macbeth’s Prayer to Spirits

> “The raven himself is hoarse
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
That tend on mortal thoughts! unsex me here,
And fill me from the crown to the toe top full 40
Of direst cruelty; make thick my blood,
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
That no compunctious visitings of nature
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
The effect and it! Come to my woman’s breasts, 45
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
Wherever in your sightless substances
You wait on nature’s mischief ! Come, thick night,
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes, 50
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
To cry, ‘Hold, hold!’”
> 

### The Appearance vs Reality

> “Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,
But be the serpent under ’t.”
> 

## Lady Macbeth’s Immediate Response

Having read the letter, Lady Macbeth’s immediate response to herself is that Macbeth’s nature is not suited to the task of regicide. Whereas Holinshed’s Macbeth has a cruel nature, Lady Macbeth informs the audience that Shakespeare’s Macbeth is “full o’ the milk of human kindness” and possesses the ambition but not the cruelty to “catch the nearest way” to the throne (16–17). She reminds us of Macbeth’s internal conflict, which we witnessed in earlier scenes. In her soliloquy, Lady Macbeth also details her plans to “pour” her spirits into her husband’s ear so that he can overcome his nature and take the crown (25). Interestingly, in Hamlet, Claudius kills his brother King Hamlet by pouring poison into his ear. This connection between plays suggests a link between Lady Macbeth and regicide. When Lady Macbeth learns that Duncan is staying at their castle that night, she becomes the first character to actually voice the regicidal act that is required. She indicates that the raven, a traditional metaphor for a messenger, will “croak the fatal entrance” of the king under her battlements (37–38). Here, she assumes a dominant role over the castle defense — its battlements — a role that is typically held by the lord of the castle.

## “Unsex me”

This assumption of masculinity continues in one of her most famous speeches, which comes in the form of a prayer. Interestingly, this prayer is directed toward “spirits,” which means that her religious attitudes are pagan (38). The prayer indicates that these spirits are malignant. Gender becomes a key issue as Lady Macbeth asks the spirits to “unsex” her. She wants the spirits to remove from her any feminine attributes that will interfere with her plan to murder Duncan. The request implies that men are more capable of cruelty than women. Lady Macbeth’s words are ironic because Macbeth, who has excelled in military prowess, is conflicted about committing murder. Even before her prayer, Lady Macbeth seems more suited to committing regicide than her husband.

### Macbeth’s Indecision

When Macbeth arrives, he shows no indication that he plans to commit a crime toward Duncan. He tells Lady Macbeth that the king will depart from their household the next morning. In keeping with her more active role, Lady Macbeth warns her husband not to let his face betray his thoughts, once again invoking a separation between illusion and reality. Lady Macbeth also describes her husband as the serpent under the bush. Interestingly, he later appropriates the same metaphor when referring to Banquo and Fleance. Macbeth refuses to commit to any course of action regarding the sisters’ prophecy. He puts off any decisions, as he did with Banquo in the third scene, until a later discussion. However, he also does nothing to stop his wife’s preparations for the demise of Duncan. Lady Macbeth’s active and dominant role in this situation enables the audience to feel more sympathy with Macbeth, who is obviously tormented by being caught between his ambition and his knowledge of right and wrong.

# Act 1, Scene 6

---

King Duncan and his men arrive at Macbeth’s castle, commenting on the pleasant surroundings. Lady Macbeth courteously welcomes them and takes them inside.

Duncan’s arrival at Macbeth’s castle transpires in this short scene. It opens with Duncan and his party in front of the castle. Shakespeare contrasts the dark and powerful discussion in the previous scene with Duncan’s trust and ignorance. Duncan comments on the castle’s “pleasant seat” and the air that is appropriate for their “gentle senses” (1–3). Ironically, there is a disjunction in appearances and reality even in nature. Whereas storms indicated a disorder in nature in earlier scenes, there is no sense of impending danger here. Banquo’s reference in line 4 to the “temple-haunting martlet,” a bird that lives in church steeples, stands in stark contrast to Lady Macbeth’s raven in the previous scene, who was supposed to “croak” Duncan’s entrance. In the previous scene, Lady Macbeth sent her husband to greet the king and cautioned him to disguise his thoughts. But Macbeth does not appear in this scene. Lady Macbeth greets the visitors by herself, and she seems to have no problem hiding her intentions. Like Macbeth in Act I, Scene 4, Lady Macbeth details her duties and their relationship to the king. She claims that as subjects of the king, their belongings are at his disposal, and she says that any service they provide to the king does not measure up to the honors he has bestowed on them. Hand in hand, she conducts the king under the battlements and into her castle. Despite the frequent references to love and the pleasantness of the castle, the final image of Lady Macbeth leading Duncan into the castle is a sinister one.

# Act 1, Scene 7

---

Macbeth leaves the banquet to wrestle with his conscience. When Lady Macbeth enters, he tells her that they should not kill Duncan. Lady Macbeth criticises his lack of courage and quickly persuades her husband with a plan to murder the King while he sleeps.

## Consequences after the Killing

Although Macbeth had extended asides earlier in the act, he opens this scene with his first true soliloquy. In this speech, he examines regicide rationally from a variety of perspectives. He realises that the impact of a decision to kill the king will not end with the murder itself. The consequences of regicide would be extensive. For instance, from a religious perspective, Duncan’s death would “jump” or risk the afterlife because murder is a mortal sin (7). Furthermore, from a more earthbound standpoint, Macbeth understands that as king he would be as vulnerable to regicide as Duncan. And finally, the act of regicide would violate not only his bond to Duncan as a subject but also his bond as a blood relative. Thus, Macbeth demonstrates that he is acutely aware of the implications of his proposed action. Macbeth also knows that there is no good reason for him to commit such an act, because Duncan is a virtuous and good king. With horror, he also ponders the enormous grief that would grip the country if Duncan were killed. Notice that he makes this argument in terms of natural disorder, indicating that “tears shall drown the wind” if Duncan dies (25). Ultimately, his personal ambition is the only reason to commit regicide. 

## Rationalising Regicide

Lady Macbeth interrupts the soliloquy by asking why he is not with the king’s party. At this point, Macbeth has decided once again to turn away from the evil deed of regicide. He strongly informs Lady Macbeth that they will not proceed with their plans. Notice the reappearance of clothing metaphors as she responds by asking, “Was the hope drunk / Wherein you dress’d yourself?” (35-36). For the remainder of the scene, Lady Macbeth works to alter her husband’s resolve. She begins by returning to the issue of gender, questioning his masculinity by calling him a coward. The “poor cat i’ the adage” that Lady Macbeth refers to here is the Latin phrase ‘*catus amat pisces sed non vult tingere plantas’* (45). The phrase means that the cat loves fish but does not wish to wet his feet. This saying accurately describes Macbeth; he possesses the ambition to be king but not the resolve to take the action necessary to achieve it. Macbeth defends himself by claiming that not killing the king actually makes him more of a man. His reason tells him that killing a king, especially one who trusts him as much as Duncan does, diminishes his manhood. Lady Macbeth’s response may shed light on Macbeth’s initial reaction to the prediction by the weird sisters. By referring to a previous moment where neither the time nor the place were convenient for this act — Macbeth “would make both” (52) — she seems to indicate that the plan to kill Duncan may not be a recent one. In fact, she gives us, for the first time, an indication that Macbeth may have broached the subject even before the prophecy. Possibly, Macbeth was already susceptible to the idea of regicide when he was on the battlefield defending Duncan. Lady Macbeth next attacks her husband’s honor. She claims that had she sworn to kill her own child, she would. Lady Macbeth’s evil disposition seems to reach its peak in this statement as she demonstrates her monstrous determination. Through inverted logic, she indicates that honoring a commitment to regicide is more important than honoring a commitment to one’s king.

## Emotion Versus Reason | Blinded by Emotions Versus Logic

Notice that Lady Macbeth argues on emotion. Her passionate arguments contrast sharply with Macbeth’s more rational exploration of the consequences of murder, which opened the scene. Pay attention to the behavior of the Macbeths after the crime. Consider whether they still act with the same respective focus on reason and emotion. In this speech, Lady Macbeth mentions that she has been a mother. This line may be confusing because the Macbeths are childless. However, Sidney Lamb points out that Lady Macbeth had a child with her first husband; Macbeth is her second husband. Regardless, it is important to keep in mind that because Lady Macbeth is childless, she runs no risk of having to act on her horrific statement. Lady Macbeth describes to her husband how they will commit the crime and subsequently frame Duncan’s servants for the murder. After she assures him that they will not be blamed for the crime, a shift occurs in Macbeth. Although he still realises that regicide is wrong, he commits to that course of action. Macbeth’s final line of the scene — “False face must hide what the false heart doth know” — illustrates the disparity between his face, which is false because it is not an accurate representation, and his heart, which is false because he is being traitorous (82). The full title indicates that this play is a tragedy, and the choice that ends this first act begins Macbeth’s tragic fall. Under the notion of divine right kingship (see the Introduction to Early Modern England), regicide is the highest crime. After Shakespeare’s protagonist pledges himself to that course of action, we should consider whether we are still sympathetic with the play’s central character, and if so, why.
