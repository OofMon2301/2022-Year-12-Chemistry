## Poor Writing Example 1

### What is wrong with it

- **Overly Similar Names -** James and Jason
- **Poor Dialogue Tags -** Words like *announced, exclaimed, smiled, laughed, queried, and explained* draw attention to themselves - rather than to the actual dialogue. They sound like the author is trying too hard.
- **Using the Wrong Word -** confidence instead of confidant
- **Potentially Confusing Phrasing -** We’re told that “lots of people were walking back and forth” in the street. This seems to imply that the same people are walking one way and then back the other way which is unlikely to be the case.
- **Irrelevant Details -** The information about people walking in the streets is hardly worth mentioning. We’d expect it
- **Over-Explaining by the Author -** Self-explanatory

## Poor Writing Example 2

- **Confusing Use of Pronouns -** He, They
- **Using Phrases instead of Character Names -** Dave is referred to as the tall man. It would be better to simply use his name.
- **Too Much Irrelevant Information -** Some of this is stating the obvious (the cars ‘stopped obediently’ at the traffic lights - which is exactly what you’d expect them to do) and some seems like a tangent from the scene (Jason’s memories about school and the fact that he didn’t go to the reunion”)
- **Redundant Phrasing -** “Jason quickly strode across with long steps.” Just “Jason strode across” would do just fine.

# Description

It was a warm day in May and something wasn’t right. There were grey clouds in the sky. We drove along the drive to the castle. The air felt hot around us.

May. You could feel the warmth in the air. The atmosphere was strange and uncomfortable. You could see angry, grey clouds in the distance looking threatening. The car was old, it struggled up the narrow, bumpy driveway. The air felt humid and uncomfortable. It was stifling 

May. Warmth hung in the air and wrapped itself around me like a heavy jumper, adding to the uncomfortable and oppressive atmosphere. Menacing grey clouds loomed in the distance; rain was imminent. An old Ford Cortina coughed and spluttered its way up the narrow drive, struggling to negotiate the uneven ground. The air smelled stale; you could almost taste the mould and the odour clung relentlessly.

### Tips for Description

- Engage a reader’s senses - see, hear, taste, feel, touch
- Choose precise imagery (avoid overusing abstract nouns) - The air smelt like freedom when he was finally released from prison.
- Remember subtle differences between describing words - When you're looking

## Specificity - White teeth by Zadie Smith

### Specificity

- Specificity of words
- Specificity of ideas
- Words that are concrete and particular rather than general, abstract or vague.

### Short Story Genre

- Must have characters
- Must have action balanced with descriptions
- Not a recount
- It is not a reflection on your character’s thoughts
- Something must happen even if it is very small
- Have an obvious conceptual link to __________(The Drover’s Wife)
- Adhere to the patterns and conventions suitable to short-story - Orientation, Climax, at least two Characters, Conclusion
