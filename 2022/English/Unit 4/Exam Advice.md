## Subject Report Advice

Preparation for this item should not be limited to detailed analysis of the springboard text. Students require an understanding of the prescribed text sufficient to generate a response of their own to the representations and perspectives it offers. Effective preparation for this task will engage students in the genre patterns of the effective response.

Effective preparation prior to the examination’s release should prioritise guiding students to consider their own reactions to the perspectives and representations evident in the literary text, and what the text offers them in understanding their own social environment and experiences. This will facilitate the development of a clear focus for their own creative responses and assist them in the planning phase of the examination.
