## Act 5, Scene 1

---

Macbeth and his wife are now living in the castle at Dunsinane. A doctor and a waiting woman are discussing Lady Macbeth’s strange behaviour. While they are talking Lad Macbeth appears walking in her sleep. As she walks she relives some of the events that took place shorty after Duncan’s death, and in doing so she reveals that she was involved in his murder. Once she has gone the doctor remarks that her sickness is of the mind, not the body. He is greatly disturbed by what he has learnt.

This famous scene depicting Lady Macbeth sleepwalking is original to Shakespeare. It marks a significant change from Holinshed’s portrayal of Macbeth’s wife. The doctor’s comments at the opening of the scene alert us that this sleepwalking is a recent occurrence. The doctor indicates that this is the third night he has kept watch, at the gentlewoman’s request, to witness Lady Macbeth’s odd behavior. The gentlewoman’s response not only informs the audience that Macbeth has left to do battle with the English forces but also reconnects Lady Macbeth with writing and, specifically, letters. Recall that when Shakespeare introduced Lady Macbeth in Act I, Scene 5, she was reading a letter from Macbeth. She also uses diction connected to reading and writing in many of her lines. Because literacy rates were low in Early Modern England, lower in medieval Scotland, and even lower for women during both periods, Shakespeare seems to be stressing Lady Macbeth’s learning. How does perceiving Lady Macbeth as literate change our perception of her? Also, consider how this sleepwalking scene changes our perception of her.

### Lady Macbeth’s transformation

---

The first sense that a major change has occurred in Lady Macbeth comes when the gentlewoman informs the doctor that Lady Macbeth requires light at all times. Contrast this to her earlier lines, “Come, thick night, / And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell, / That my keen knife see not the wound it makes” (I.5.48–50). Earlier, she requested darkness. Now she demands light. The theme of sleep returns in this scene. Recall that in Act II, Scene 2, Macbeth told his wife of the voices that claimed he would no longer be able to sleep because he had murdered sleep. Lady Macbeth can sleep, but not peacefully; she is haunted by dreams of the evil deeds she and Macbeth have committed. Lady Macbeth dreams that there is a spot of blood on her hands that she is unable to clean. She seems to have reversed roles with her husband. In Act II, Scene 2, immediately after the king’s murder, Macbeth believed that he would never be able to wash the blood from his hands. At that time, Lady Macbeth asserted that a “little water” could wash away the blood as well as the guilt. Now, while Macbeth seems to have rid himself of all remorse for his actions, Lady Macbeth realises that “all the perfumes of Arabia” could not cover the scent of blood on her hands (44).

### “What’s done is done”

---

Lady Macbeth’s lines recount many of the deeds she and her husband have committed; she seems haunted by memories of Duncan, Banquo, and Macduff’s wife. In line 59, she states that “What’s done cannot be undone.” Compared to her line in Act III, Scene 2 — “What’s done is done” — her words here indicate what a complete change has occurred in her conscience. Notice how closely these two lines mirror each other but how significant the slight change in wording is to the meaning of each. Shakespeare often plays upon the subtleties of language to demonstrate how easily meaning can change. The doctor rightly connects Lady Macbeth’s inner turmoil to her actions. He describes both the turmoil and the deeds as “[u]nnatural” (62). This parallels Lady Macbeth’s request in Act I, Scene 5 for spirits to make her unnatural by “unsexing” her, or removing her feminine qualities. The doctor also fears that Lady Macbeth may try to commit suicide, and he orders that “the means of all annoyance” — anything she might use to hurt herself — be removed from her possession (67). His words foreshadow her death. The doctor and the gentlewoman make frequent references to God and heaven in this scene. But we realise that Lady Macbeth, like her husband, has forsaken God and cannot seek divine aid for her troubled mind. While Macbeth moves from inner turmoil to remorseless determination during the course of the play, Lady Macbeth moves in the opposite direction, which will soon prove fatal.

Lady Macbeth by Henry Fuseli, 1784.

## Act 5, Scene 2

---

A group of Scottish nobles loyal to Malcolm meet to prepare for the final battle against Macbeth. They arrange to meet the English army near Birnam Wood.

This short scene begins a segment of six scenes that are all related to the final battle. Here, a number of Scottish noblemen discuss Macbeth (absent from the play since Act IV, Scene 1) and his actions. Pay particular attention to the references to man and manhood that implicitly place the violence of this battle in the realm of the masculine. Lennox’s reference to Old Siward’s son and the “first of manhood,” those men who are proving their masculinity in battle for the first time, foreshadows Macbeth’s deadly encounter with Young Siward in the last scene (11). The reference to Birnam Wood in line 5 should raise a signal. Recall that this is the forest that has to move to Dunsinane hill (on top of which stands Dunsinane castle where Macbeth is fortified) in order for Macbeth to be vanquished. Keep in mind that Malcolm and his army know nothing about the witches or the prophecy. Angus’s description of Macbeth defines a significant contrast between this new king and King Duncan. Macbeth’s troops follow him because he commands them to; they do not follow him out of love. Recall the love and devotion that Duncan gave and received in the opening scenes of the play. Notice the reference to robes and clothing again in lines 21 and 22. Angus says that Macbeth now “feel[s] his title / Hang loose about him, like a giant’s robe / Upon a dwarfish thief.” Macbeth’s new title does not fit his character. Interestingly, there is a note of sympathy in the voices of many of these noblemen for Macbeth’s torment and, in particular, his descent into madness. It is important not to lose sight of the fact that despite Macbeth’s tyranny, these thanes all seemed to be close friends at the beginning of play.

## Act 5, Scene 3

---

Macbeth prepares to defend the castle of Dunsinane against the rebel army. Although he tries to convince himself that the witches’ prophecies will ensure that he is victorious, he realises that he cannot look forward to a peaceful old age. The Doctor tells him that he cannot cure Lady Macbeth because her illness is of the mind, not the body.

This scene marks Macbeth’s reemergence onstage and provides the audience with a glimpse of his state of mind. The audience views a pitiful picture of the once admirable and once tyrannical Macbeth. As Sidney Lamb notes, the presence of the doctor with Macbeth implies his mental illness. Notice that in accordance with Hecate’s wishes, Macbeth suffers from overconfidence as a result of the prophecies. It is apparent, however, that he is torn between this overconfidence and the knowledge that the English army is approaching. In contrast to his wife, Macbeth now cannot stand anything light or white. He yells at the servant who is, of course, white with fear, wishing that the devil would blacken him. After the servant departs, Macbeth’s behavior changes. Rather than being overly aggressive and confident, he becomes more melancholic. He admits that he is “sick at heart” (19). Macbeth now realises that the disjunction between a man’s face and his heart that he previously used to his advantage is being used against him. Like Angus’s remarks in the previous scene, Macbeth knows that he commands no “honour, love, [or] obedience” and that he is hated instead (25). This realisation makes it difficult to hate Macbeth. Shakespeare evokes pity for the fallen man. Throughout the rest of the scene, Macbeth oscillates between being overly aggressive and confident and being melancholic. Macbeth’s premature calls for his armor indicate his need for action; being static seems only to make him more melancholy. While on one hand Macbeth seems to believe that he cannot be harmed, he also hints that he may actually be looking for death. His frequent declarations that he has nothing to fear begin to ring hollow, especially in light of his sentiment that he has “liv’d long enough” (22).

Here, Macbeth himself makes the connection between Lady Macbeth and writing, describing her insanity as “written troubles” (42). He questions the doctor in lines 40 through 45 about the possibility of curing Lady Macbeth’s ills. But the questions he asks apply equally to Macbeth himself. Notice that in the doctor’s response, he does not specify which of the Macbeths he means but does indicate that the patient must treat “himself” (46). Macbeth responds angrily to this answer, repudiating medicine entirely. He realises that at this point nothing can save him from his guilt. Macbeth’s inquiry to the doctor about whether or not he can cure Scotland and “return it to sound and pristine health” rings ironic, because Macbeth himself is the cause of the destruction of his country (52). This line, however, also creates a bit of sympathy for Macbeth; for the first time, he seems to display a love for his country and a sense of regret for its struggles. The final lines of the scene illustrate how truly alone and abandoned Macbeth is, because even his doctor indicates a desire to be away from the mad tyrant. One of the implications of Macbeth’s loneliness may be that we understand the important role noblemen play in the happiness of a king. Clearly, Macbeth’s ambition to be king has been filled. But, unlike Duncan, Macbeth has no followers. The throne brought Macbeth power and control, but it did not bring him happiness and fulfillment. Wearing the crown merely spurred his descent into tyranny and evil.

## Act 5, Scene 4

---

The rebel forces have now reached Birnam Wood where Malcolm orders each man to cut down a branch and carry it in front of him. This camouflage will be used to conceal the number of soldiers in the army.

In this scene, the Scottish nobles unite forces with Malcolm and the English army. The presence of these nobles dramatically depicts Macbeth’s solitude. They also create a spectacular scene on stage, showing the military might of these forces. The “drums” and “colours” referred to in the stage directions provide us with a glimpse of the visual and auditory power of this scene. The theme of sleep reappears with Malcolm’s hope that their chambers or bedrooms will be safe after Macbeth is defeated. In addition to serving as a reminder of the manner in which his father died, this line also refers to the sleeplessness that has gripped Scotland (III.5.34). The audience discovers how the first prophecy will come true: Malcolm’s forces will use tree branches to disguise their numbers as they approach the castle. (Ironically, as we learned in the previous scene, Macbeth already knows their numbers.) This pragmatic use of camouflage stands in stark contrast to the supernatural elements in the play. Here, the audience can also see the equivocation in the witches’ prophecies. The woods will not actually move, but then again, they will.

## Act 5, Scene 5

---

Macbeth still relies on the witches’ prophecies to secure him victory. However, when he hears of his wife’s death his fears return. A messenger arrives to report that Birnam Woof seems to be moving. Macbeth then prepares to leave his castle and fight.

Paralleling the last scene, this scene begins with drums and colors in its representation of Macbeth’s forces. Notice that Macbeth is the only person of nobility in his procession. The only other named character is one of his officers, Seyton. The final segment of Act V consists of short scenes with rapid shifts in perspective, moving from one side of the battle to the other. This strategy is typical of Shakespeare’s battle scenes and serves to increase the drama of the last scenes as the play pulls closer and closer to the actual battle.

### Preparing for a siege

---

Rather than meet Malcolm’s army on the battlefield, Macbeth, whose army has been significantly reduced by deserters, has to resort to forcing his enemies to siege the castle. A siege could occur in two ways: First, the army could try to scale the walls of the castle or force its way through the gates while the army inside could attack from above. This tactic was very costly to the attacking army. The other possibility was to surround the castle and not allow food or water to enter. Depending on the provisions of the castle, this was a slow but effective method. Macbeth’s resolve to stay put and let Malcolm attack the castle seems to contradict his earlier urgency to don his armor and begin the battle. Macbeth claims that a siege would be unsuccessful because his castle is too strong to attack and he has enough provisions to last until the “famine” and “ague” (or fever) consume the opposing army (4).

### Lady Macbeth’s demise

---

Macbeth and Seyton hear a woman’s cry, and Macbeth’s response reveals his deadening emotion — quite a departure from when he was originally consumed by the horror of his deeds. Now he has “almost forgot the taste of fears” (9). Seyton leaves to investigate the source of the cry and returns to report the queen’s death. Macbeth’s response to the news about his wife contains one of his most famous passages, in which we can see his desire for death reaching its peak. Modern scholars are particularly interested in these lines because he metaphorically expresses his pessimism about life in terms of the theatre. This metaphor linking theatre to life is not unique to Macbeth; compare this speech to the lines “All the world’s a stage, / And all the men and women merely players,” which appear in As You Like It (II.7.138–139). Upon learning that the woods are moving toward the hill, Macbeth seems to realise that the weird sisters have duped him. Doubting their “equivocation,” he now understands that the “fiend” (most likely a reference to Hecate or the devil) “lies like truth” (43–44). Despite beginning the scene content to let Malcolm and his forces lay siege to his castle, Macbeth’s desire for death prompts his attack. He still seems to be concerned with his masculinity, indicating that it would be best to die in armor.

## Act 5, Scene 6

---

The soldiers in Malcolm’s army throw down their branches and get ready for battle.

Continuing the scene shifts between alternating perspectives, this scene is visually, more than textually, rich and marks the beginning of the actual battle between Macbeth and his enemies. The theme of disguise appears in Malcolm’s order for the army to discard its “screens” and “show like those you are” (1–2). In contrast to the many previous references to characters disguising their inner nature, appearances match reality here — the soldiers show their true selves when facing Macbeth’s troops. Macduff’s lines at the end of this scene dramatically represent his grief transformed into anger, recalling Malcolm’s advice to Macduff in Act IV, Scene 3.

## Act 5, Scene 7

---

Macbeth meets young Siward on the battlefield and kills him. He then moves on, looking for more victims. Macduff seeks, but cannot find Macbeth. Malcolm and old Siward reveal that the castle has surrendered.

This scene marks the actual start of the battle onstage. Here, Macbeth displays a fierce determination to fight. In the opening lines, Macbeth refers to bear-baiting, which was a popular sport in Early Modern England. In bear-baiting, dogs attacked a bear that was staked in the middle of an arena. The contest ended with either the bear’s death or the death of the dogs. There was a bear-baiting pit extremely close to the Globe theatre (the theatre in which this play originally would have been staged). Previously, the perspective of each short scene in Act V shifted between one army and another. Here, the perspectives rapidly shift within the scene. Because Shakespeare did not designate scene divisions in this text (such divisions were a development of the Folio), some editors break each shift into a different scene. In the opening moments of the scene, Macbeth encounters and fights Young Siward. Macbeth wins, of course, because Young Siward was born of a woman. In addition to depicting the death of one of the promising youths participating in the battle (see the commentary for Act V, Scene 2), this struggle increases the suspense in the audience. Because Birnam wood has, in a way, come to Dunsinane, the audience suspects that somehow, there may be a man not born of a woman who will defeat Macbeth. But we do not know yet how that is possible. The scene’s perspective next switches to Macduff, who is looking only for Macbeth. The discussion between Old Siward and Malcolm reveals that Macbeth’s army is not resisting Malcolm’s forces, thus increasing Macbeth’s isolation even further. Even those soldiers who did not desert Macbeth’s army purposely miss their targets. Malcolm relates this when he says, “We have met with foes / That strike beside us” (28–29). And the strong castle — the one supposedly able to withstand any siege — has already been surrendered.

## Act 5, Scene 8

---

Macduff finally finds Macbeth. They fight. While they pause for breath, Macduff tells Macbeth that he was born by Caesarean section and therefore is “not of woman born” in the normal sense. Macduff then kills Macbeth.

The beginning of this concluding scene shows Macbeth rejecting the idea of suicide. This rejection foreshadows the end of the scene, when we finally learn how Lady Macbeth died. Because this rejection comes in the form of a rhetorical question to himself, we can infer that Macbeth has been contemplating suicide prior to the scene’s opening. If Macbeth truly believes that “none of woman born” can harm him, as the prophecy indicated, then the extent of Macbeth’s torment and madness are even more evident here. What else but torment and madness would prompt him to commit suicide in the face of such a promising prophecy? Macduff’s entrance begins their final encounter. Immediately, Macbeth learns that Macduff was “[u]ntimely ripp’d” from his mother’s womb, and the final piece of the prophecy puzzle falls into place (16). Macduff’s birth was unnatural; instead of being born naturally, he was forcibly removed from his mother through caesarian delivery. Macbeth responds to this information by refusing to fight. This refusal adds an interesting twist: If Macduff fulfills his rage by killing Macbeth, he will be killing a defenseless man and, to some extent, will dishonor himself. In a move reminiscent of Lady Macbeth and her psychological manipulation, Macduff calls Macbeth a coward. He tells him that his army will turn Macbeth into a spectacle and put him on display if he refuses to fight. Macduff’s words provoke Macbeth to action; he once again decides to attempt to defy the prophecy. Calling for a fight to the death, Macbeth and Macduff battle their way offstage. Malcolm and the other nobles enter. Old Siward informs us that the victory is “cheaply bought,” meaning that their army has suffered only light casualties (37). Of course, the victory was not “cheaply bought” for Old Siward; he will soon learn that he lost his son to Macbeth. Shakespeare pulls Old Siward’s reaction to the news of his son’s death from Holinshed’s account of Edward the Confessor. This reaction meshes nicely with the previous discussions of masculinity in the play. Young Siward, we learn, died “like a man” (43). Furthermore, Old Siward’s form of grief recalls other expressions of grief in the play, particularly Macduff’s in Act IV, Scene 3. Siward chooses not to grieve because his son “parted well” and is, therefore, with God (52).

Macbeth refusing to lose, Stephen Billington in a 1996 Royal Shakespeare Company production.

Macduff’s reentry with Macbeth’s head in hand marks the culmination of Macbeth’s fall, which not only resulted in his death but the desecration of his body. Malcolm transforms his thanes (a title that connotes a warrior culture) into earls (a title that connotes increased nobility and, specifically, a connection to England). This change may signal Malcolm’s civilising effect on Scotland. Remember the dichotomy between the two countries that Shakespeare has established. Having lived in England and witnessed its level of civility, Malcolm is able to change Scotland for the better. Here, Malcolm echoes his father, Duncan. He refers to the processes of restoring order to Scotland as being “planted newly” (65). This line recalls Duncan’s statement to Macbeth in Act I, Scene 4 that he has “begun to plant” Macbeth. This suggests that Malcolm’s ascension to the throne restores the order that was present during Duncan’s reign. We also finally learn that Lady Macbeth committed suicide. What is the effect of delaying this information until the final lines? How does her means of death alter our perception of Lady Macbeth? Malcolm’s sentiment that things will be performed in their “measure, time and place” is another indication that order has been restored (73). The play ends with Malcolm’s thanks and invitation for everyone to attend his coronation at Scone. These lines, in addition to being a proper ending for the plot, are a fitting end to the play and may have been directed at the audience. Order and happiness have been restored to the kingdom with the restoration of God’s appointed deputy.

## Act 5, Scene 9

---

Inside the castle Malcolm and his allies have achieved victory with few losses. Young Siward is dead, but he died bravely. Macduff joins them carrying Macbeth’s head. Malcolm makes his thanes earls and invites them all to Scone to see him crowned.
