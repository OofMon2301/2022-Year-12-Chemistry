|                Fair is foul and foul is fair...                 | The setting of *Macbeth* is Scotland, a country renowned for its bleak landscape and heavy mist and fog. Witches were often depicted as old crones and were believed to reside in isolated settings such as marches and bogs. The penalty for witchcraft was execution                                                                                   | Paradoxical Quote, Binary Quote      |
| By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes.  | William Shakespeare's inclusion of supernatural characters would have appealed to King James I as Shakespeare's theatre company, now known as "The king's Men", had come under royal patronage in 1603. King James I published his own book, "Daemonologie" in 1603 that asserted his belief in magic and witchcraft and the punishment for such heresy. | Foreshadowing, Point of View         |
|               A drum, a drum! Macbeth doth come.                | Drummers played a significant role during wartime and battles. The cadence of the drumming enabled the soldiers to "hold" their positions by marching in synchronisation with the beat. Also, the different drumming rhythms signfied different positions of attack, defense, and retreat.                                                               | Symbolism, Point of View             |
| Aye, sir, all this is so: but why stands Macbeth thus amazedly? | James I descended from Scottish ancestors. A scottish play would have interested him, particularly in its legitimisation of his claim to the throne. It was commonly believed King James I descended from Banquo, thane of Lochaber, and legitimised his claim to the throne through the Stuart line of kings.                                           | Equivocation, Rhetorical Question    |
|           O full of scorpions is my mind dear wife...           | 17th century England was incredibly superstitious and they believed in witches and magic. The art of predicting the future was considered a 'black' magic associated with the Devil and any communication with, or exhibition of such powers was considered punishable by death.                                                                         | Foreshadowing, motif, imagery, irony |
